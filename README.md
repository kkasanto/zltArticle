 Basic article newsletter system

 This is a basic article/newsletter web system.

 I am still learning Razor/ASP.net - and this is build as a very simple system to expand on.


 You can create Article groups, and in these groups you can create articles.

 Please let me know if and how you use it.

 Techstack: ASP.net 9 - Razor - Entity Framework - Bootstrap - MS SQL server
 3rd party : Mce Tiny editor in GPL license.

 
 The system is only the backend - you will have to create your own frontend to publish the articles.
 
  
 The system is developed as a baseline newsletter module, i intend to use in a larger system.
